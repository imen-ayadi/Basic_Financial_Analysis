In this brief video, I showcase my Power BI Dashboard for basic financial analysis. The dashboard includes key metrics such as total revenue, average revenue, total countries, and transaction count. It also features visualizations like a pie chart displaying total revenue by region and a bar plot illustrating revenue by country. Additionally, the dashboard offers filters for analyzing revenue by year, quarter, and store. With this powerful tool, you can gain valuable insights into financial performance and make informed decisions.
